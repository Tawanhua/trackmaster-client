The frontend of the Task Manager Application is developed using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides a responsive and intuitive user interface for managing tasks efficiently. The frontend communicates with the backend through RESTful API endpoints, enabling seamless interaction with task-related data.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

## Project Description

The backend of the Task Manager Application is developed using Java with Spring Boot framework. It provides a RESTful API for managing tasks, allowing users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The backend interacts with a MySQL database to store task-related data, including task titles, descriptions, due dates, and status.

Key Components:

* React.js: Utilized for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces. React components are modular and reusable, facilitating the development of complex UI elements.

* Hooks: React Hooks such as useState and useEffect, for managing component state and lifecycle.

* Axios: A lightweight HTTP client for making asynchronous HTTP requests to the backend API endpoints. Axios simplifies data fetching and handling of responses.

* User Interface Components: HTML, CSS, and JSX are used to design and implement user interface components such as task lists, task forms, and task items. CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Material-UI may be utilized for styling and layout.

* State Management: React state is utilized to manage the application's state, including task data and user input. State changes trigger re-rendering of components, ensuring a responsive user experience.

* Client-Side Routing: React Router can be integrated for client-side routing, enabling navigation between different views within the application without full-page reloads.
